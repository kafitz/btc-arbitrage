btc-arbitrage
=============
(main private fork of bitcoin-arbitrage) - will run independently <br />
IRC version found here: https://github.com/kafitz/bitbot

Live trading mode will need:

* the ability to monitor the amounts of funds we have in each exchange so that we can focus only on trades that we are able to make. (so if we had $0 in mtgox and $10 in bitstamp, we would only see the trade for bitstamp --> intersango and not one from mtgox --> intersango)
* the fees involved with every exchange we use. This way we can add a calculator function that will only execute trades that are profitable to us after the cost of making the transaction.
* as many exchanges as we can, concentrating on those with buy/sell APIs so we can automate the process.

###### Future modifications:
Extending btc-arbitrage to include our own math can be done through editing *def arbitrage_opportunity()* in *arbitrage.py*. <br />
*def arbitrage_opportunity(self, kask, ask, kbid, bid)* takes the following arguments as generated by its calling function, *def tick()*:
- kask: *string* of exchange1's name
- ask: dict of lowest asking price and available volume - {'price': 45.06, 'amount': 18.42}
- kbid: *string* of exchange2's name
- bid: dict of highest big price and available volume - {'price': 56.0932, 'amount': 14.5}
